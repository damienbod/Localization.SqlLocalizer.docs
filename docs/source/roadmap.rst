Roadmap
=======

1.0
---

For 1.0 I want to make Kong kick ass at running Twill tests in the browser.
This is it's main purpose, and 1.0 will hopefully hit this out of the park.


2.0
---

In 2.0 I want to expand Kong to more than Twill tests. I want to be able to run twill tests off of the filesystem. Also I want to be able to have other "backend" types of tests, basically anything returning a 0/1/2, much like nagios.
